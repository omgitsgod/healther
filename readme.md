**Overview**

Blockstack allows users to have ownership of their own data, in essence a univeral ID. We believe that blockstack would allow for a good use case regarding EHRs. The current state of the app will let you sign in to the application with your id and  upload health records/files/images to your personal gaia hub. In the future we hope to be able to give other users (doctors) read access to their records and for you to be able to request records automatically from the doctor's hub based on a request form that will trigger a transfer of the latest records.
